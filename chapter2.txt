jay - A 2000 article in the Indian Express noted that
"an aura of secrecy envelops the school and entry is
strictly forbidden."[2] The article quoted a director
of the school as saying "...we donâ€™t like the
vibrations to be polluted by outsiders. Sometimes we
even tell parents not to come here." Students are
schooled in 'vibratory awareness'[2] which practitioners
say enables them to detect and treat subtle imbalances
in themselves and others.[6] This is part of the 
school's vision of fulfilling the students' physical,
emotional, intellectual and, above all, spiritual 
potential.[7]

dev - According to the school website, Sahaja Yoga
education "envisages the development of the child 
in an atmosphere where the innate qualities, such as 
innocence and wisdom, are protected and enhanced; where
the students imbibe the timeless and unchanging valueswhich come from inner awareness, and are not subject
to the vagaries of fashion, religion or national
culture."[8] The Indian Express article noted that 
the "dormitories are austere, even monastic in 
appearance".
