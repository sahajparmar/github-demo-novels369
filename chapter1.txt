sahaj school - Judith Coney reports that the school has
accepted children from the age of four and notes that 
"often very young children are separated from their 
natural parents for prolonged periods, as they usually
stay in India for nine months".[4] An Indian newspaper 
article published in 2000 reported that students at 
the time were aged six and above.[2]

jagrut - An official school statement said that the
villagers bring presents to the students and enjoy
looking after them. A 1995 report on the school by
the Austrian Ministry of Justice has said that
uninvited visitors 'dropping in' have been refused
entry[5]
