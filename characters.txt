sahaj school - Judith Coney reports that the school has
accepted children from the age of four and notes that 
"often very young children are separated from their 
natural parents for prolonged periods, as they usually
stay in India for nine months".[4] An Indian newspaper 
article published in 2000 reported that students at 
the time were aged six and above.[2]

jagrut - An official school statement said that the
villagers bring presents to the students and enjoy
looking after them. A 1995 report on the school by
the Austrian Ministry of Justice has said that
uninvited visitors 'dropping in' have been refused
entry[5]

jay - A 2000 article in the Indian Express noted that
"an aura of secrecy envelops the school and entry is
strictly forbidden."[2] The article quoted a director
of the school as saying "...we donâ€™t like the
vibrations to be polluted by outsiders. Sometimes we
even tell parents not to come here." Students are
schooled in 'vibratory awareness'[2] which practitioners
say enables them to detect and treat subtle imbalances
in themselves and others.[6] This is part of the 
school's vision of fulfilling the students' physical,
emotional, intellectual and, above all, spiritual 
potential.[7]

dev - According to the school website, Sahaja Yoga
education "envisages the development of the child 
in an atmosphere where the innate qualities, such as 
innocence and wisdom, are protected and enhanced; where
the students imbibe the timeless and unchanging valueswhich come from inner awareness, and are not subject
to the vagaries of fashion, religion or national
culture."[8] The Indian Express article noted that 
the "dormitories are austere, even monastic in 
appearance".
